  "example": "➤ The Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37)\nA lawyer came to Jesus testing Him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? Jesus responded by asking what was written in the law. The lawyer correctly quoted Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 19:18 about loving God and neighbor. But wanting to justify himself, he asked, And who is my neighbor? Jesus then told this powerful parable about a man traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho who was attacked by robbers, beaten, stripped, and left half dead on the roadside.\n\n⤷ Background & audience\nJesus told this parable directly to a Jewish lawyer who was testing Him about eternal life and the greatest commandments. The setting involves the treacherous 17-mile road from Jerusalem to Jericho, which descended nearly 3,300 feet through desert wilderness known for bandits and violence. The lawyer's question about who is my neighbor reflected common Jewish interpretation that limited neighborly obligation primarily to fellow Jews, especially those who were religiously observant. The inclusion of a priest and Levite in the story would have resonated deeply with the Jewish audience, as these were the most religiously respected figures in their society. The choice of a Samaritan as the hero was deliberately shocking, as Jews and Samaritans had centuries of bitter ethnic and religious hostility, with Jews considering Samaritans to be racially mixed heretics who corrupted true worship.\n\n⤷ Main message\nJesus fundamentally redefined the concept of neighbor through this parable, showing that neighborly love transcends all racial, ethnic, religious, and social boundaries. The parable demonstrates that being a neighbor is not about proximity or ethnicity but about showing practical compassion to anyone in need. The priest and Levite, despite their religious status and knowledge of Scripture, failed to demonstrate true love by avoiding the suffering man, possibly due to concerns about ritual purity or personal safety. In contrast, the despised Samaritan showed extraordinary mercy, providing immediate first aid, transportation on his own animal, lodging at an inn, personal payment for care, and a promise to return and cover additional expenses. Jesus teaches that genuine love for God must be evidenced through sacrificial love for others, regardless of who they are or how different they may be from us.\n\n⤷ Application for today\nThis parable challenges modern believers to examine whether our love truly reflects Christ's heart for all people regardless of race, religion, social status, nationality, or personal differences. In our increasingly divided world, Christians are called to be Good Samaritans who actively seek opportunities to help those in need, even when it requires personal sacrifice, inconvenience, or crossing cultural boundaries. This means looking beyond our comfort zones to serve refugees, immigrants, the homeless, those struggling with addiction, people of different political views, or anyone society tends to marginalize. The parable also calls us to evaluate whether our religious activities and church involvement translate into practical compassion for suffering people in our communities. True discipleship involves not just knowing biblical truth but living it out through costly love that mirrors Christ's sacrificial care for others. Like the Samaritan, we should be prepared to use our resources, time, and energy to care for those God places in our path, demonstrating that love of God and love of neighbor are inseparably connected.",
