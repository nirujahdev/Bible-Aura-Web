It involves belief, trust, and commitment to God's truth. Biblical faith is both a gift from God and a response to His revelation in Scripture\n\n⤷ Practical application\nGrow faith through regular Bible study and prayer. Trust God's promises even when circumstances seem contrary. Let faith be demonstrated through obedience and good works as evidence of salvation",
