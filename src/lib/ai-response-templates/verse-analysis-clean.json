  "example": "➤ For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (John 3:16 KJV)\n\n⤷ Historical background\nThis profound statement was spoken by Jesus Christ during His nighttime conversation with Nicodemus, a prominent Pharisee and member of the Jewish ruling council, sometime around 30 AD in Jerusalem. The conversation took place during Jesus' early ministry, likely during the Passover season when many Jewish leaders were observing Jesus' miraculous signs and teaching. Nicodemus approached Jesus under cover of darkness, possibly to avoid controversy among his fellow religious leaders, seeking to understand Jesus' identity and authority. The cultural context reveals a Jewish leader struggling to comprehend how Jesus' message of spiritual rebirth and salvation differed from traditional Jewish understanding of righteousness through law-keeping and ritual observance.\n\n⤷ Theology\nThis verse encapsulates the entire Gospel message and serves as the theological cornerstone of Christian salvation doctrine. God's love agape represents His unconditional, sacrificial love that transcends human understanding and extends to all humanity regardless of nationality, social status, or moral condition. The phrase gave his only begotten Son reveals the doctrine of the Trinity and the incarnation, showing that salvation required the ultimate sacrifice of God's unique, eternal Son. The concept of believing believeth encompasses more than intellectual assent, indicating a complete trust, commitment, and reliance upon Christ for salvation. The promise of everlasting life represents not merely endless existence but qualitative eternal life that begins at the moment of faith and continues forever in fellowship with God. This verse establishes salvation by grace through faith alone, apart from works, as the foundational principle of Christian soteriology.\n\n⤷ Simple explanation\nThis verse reveals that God's immense love for humanity motivated Him to provide the perfect solution for our sin problem through Jesus Christ. Every person faces the reality of sin and its consequence, which is spiritual death and separation from God. However, God's love compelled Him to offer His own Son as the perfect sacrifice to pay the penalty for our sins. When we place our complete trust and faith in Jesus Christ, believing that His death and resurrection provide forgiveness and new life, we receive the gift of eternal life. This is not something we earn through good works or religious activities, but a free gift that God offers to everyone who believes. The eternal life that God promises is both a present reality and a future hope, beginning the moment we trust Christ and continuing forever in His presence.",
