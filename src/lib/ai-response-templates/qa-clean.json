  "example": "➤ How can I forgive someone who hurt me deeply?\n\n⤷ Bible-based answer with references\nJesus teaches us to forgive as God forgives us (Matthew 6:14-15, Ephesians 4:32). Forgiveness is a choice to release resentment, not necessarily a feeling. Christ gives us strength to forgive even the unforgivable (Philippians 4:13, Colossians 3:13)\n\n⤷ Short application\nChoose to forgive even when you don't feel like it. Pray for the person who hurt you as Jesus commanded (Matthew 5:44). Trust God to heal your heart and restore relationships in His perfect timing",
