# PostgreSQL Connection Commands for Bible Aura Community Setup

## 1. Connect to Supabase Database:
psql -h db.foleepziqgrdgkljedux.supabase.co -p 5432 -d postgres -U postgres

## 2. When prompted for password, enter:
afHRHS@B!WR6LZL

## 3. Once connected, run the safe migration:
\i safe_community_migration.sql

## 4. Or copy-paste the content from safe_community_migration.sql

## 5. Exit psql:
\q

# Alternative: Use batch file
# Run: connect_and_run_migration.bat
# (This will handle everything automatically if psql is installed)

# If you see "policy already exists" errors, those are normal and can be ignored.
# The safe migration drops existing policies first to prevent conflicts.
